Tampa has a humid subtropical climate. Its situation on the Gulf of Mexico allows the warm Gulf Stream to create mild winter weather. However, cold snaps do occur in winter in Tampa occasionally, bringing temperatures at night around freezing. Temperatures in the teens, and snow, have been recorded. However, this is very rare. From spring through fall, weather is very warm and humid, sometimes making the weather unpleasant for outdoor activities.
