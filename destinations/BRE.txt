They tell us there's an old German saying that 'people from Lübeck drink beyond their means, people from Hamburg eat beyond their means and people from Bremen live beyond their means'. It might never have been true, but it's certainly evident that Bremeners like to enjoy the finer things in life. Bremen, an outward-looking, cultural and industrial capital of its own city state, is a clear urban triumph and a highlight of any visit to the region, along with its 'daughter' city Bremerhaven, at the mouth of the River Weser and Worpswede, the century old artists’ colony on the moors.
If you like peat bogs, tidal flats, birdlife and blustery bike rides by the sea, you'll especially enjoy visiting the East Frisian coast and islands, ideally suited to slowing down the pace and immersing yourself in nature.

While rail connections to and around Bremen are excellent, you'll find a combination of buses, boats and trains necessary for exploring outlying regions and the islands. Renting a vehicle can help to keep things simple and off-schedule, so as not to interrupt your unwinding.
