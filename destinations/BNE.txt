Sophisticated city galleries and rooftop bars, desolate subtropical beaches, cool-climate vineyards: the greater Brisbane region deals in Queensland's most gasp-inducing contrasts. Star of the show is Brisbane itself, a lush, sultry metropolis with flourishing restaurant, bar and cultural scenes that attest to its coming of age. Lapping at the city's eastern fringe is Moreton Bay, home to low-lying sandy isles that beckon with their turquoise waves, sparkling forests and passing parade of whales, turtles and dolphins.
Head west from Brisbane and you'll hit lofty Toowoomba, an underrated university town where heritage architecture and well-pruned gardens share the streets with smashing street art, specialist coffee shops and a growing number of fashionable eateries and bars. Things get even cooler (literally) further south in the vineyard-laced Granite Belt, a corner of the state where surf clubs, mojitos and palm trees are ditched for elegant reds, crackling fires and the occasional mid-year snowman.
Brisbane is the region's undisputed culinary hub, with a vibrant, global scene spanning cheap-and-cheerful to celeb-chef hot spots. Reputable cafes and restaurants are increasingly common in Toowoomba, while the Granite Belt is also home to a handful of competent eateries showcasing local produce. Expect mostly generic eateries in Redcliffe, Manly, Highfields and Crows Nest.
Big-city Brisbane caters for all budgets and tastes, with everything from party hostels and budget guesthouses, to global midrange and luxury chains, as well as self-contained apartments. Beyond the city is a mixed bag of motels, smaller hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs and self-contained cottages, ranging from historic and romantic to functional and nondescript.
