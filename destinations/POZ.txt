Stroll into Poznan's central market square on any evening and you’ll receive an instant introduction to the characteristic energy of Wielkopolska’s capital. The city's Old Town district is buzzing at any time of the day, and positively jumping by night, full of people heading to its many restaurants, pubs and clubs. The combination of international business travellers attending its numerous trade fairs and the city's huge student population has created a distinctive vibe quite independent of tourism.
In addition to its energetic personality, Poznan offers many historical attractions in its centre, particularly museums, and its plentiful transport links make it a great base from which to explore the quieter surrounding countryside.
