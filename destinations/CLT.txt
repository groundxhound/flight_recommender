If it weren't for its isolation and inhospitable winters, charming Charlottetown might just be one of the loveliest, affordable places to live, anywhere. Failing that, a visit is recommended.

Historically, in 1864, it was here that the Confederation Conference set in motion a series of events that led to the birth of the nation of Canada, and while the whole compact capital in itself is like walking through a beautifully preserved local history museum, there aren't many attractions to speak of.
There is, however, a burgeoning restaurant scene capitalizing on the island's abundant seafood and fresh produce, combined with its wealth of talented graduates from the Culinary Institute of Canada. Add a lively cultural scene and you have a capital city oozing small-town feel and appeal.
