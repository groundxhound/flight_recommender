There are some 500,000 bicycles in Münster – and that's just an example of the exuberance found in this captivating city, one of the most appealing between Cologne and Hamburg.
It's beautiful centre was rebuilt after the war and features many architectural gems. Yet Münster is not mired in nostalgia. Its 50,000 students keep the cobwebs out and civic pride is great – the town's main cultural treasures have enjoyed ambitious renovations and enhancements. Plan on at least a couple nights here – sampling the many great pubs and restaurants alone will necessitate it.
