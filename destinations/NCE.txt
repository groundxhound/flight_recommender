With its mix of real-city grit, old-world opulence, year-round sunshine and stunning seaside location, Nice is the unofficial capital of the Côte d’Azur, and a must-see for every visitor. A magnet for sunseekers and high-rollers since the 19th century, this bewitching coastal city has so much going for it, it’s almost embarrassing – fabulous markets, an enticing old town, glorious architecture and a wealth of super restaurants. It’s far from perfect – it’s scruffy in spots, the traffic’s horrendous and the beach is made entirely of pebbles – but if you really want to soak up the Riviera vibe, there’s really no better place to do it.
