The largest city on the Adriatic Coast, seaside delight Split has been under Roman, Venetian, Austrian, French, Italian and Yugoslav control. There is an abundance of restaurants and wine cellars. Sites such as Diocletian's Palace and Mausoleum, the Grgur Ninski Statue and the Cathedral and Bell Tower of St. Domnius justify its position as a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site. The city's coves offer several lovely beaches, including central Bacvice. Ferries link Split to Dalmatian summer resorts. 
The city was originally built around the Diocletian palace (a palace/fort built for the retired Roman emperor Diocletian) where the locals sought refuge centuries ago. Despite initial appearances, however, the city is not a small tourist town, and extends over a large area well beyond the ancient core. With over 300,000 people in the wider bay area, it's the economic hub of the eastern Adriatic shoreline (the unofficial "capital" of Dalmatia). Wandering the historic centre of Split you can still clearly see the Roman walls, squares, and temples.
