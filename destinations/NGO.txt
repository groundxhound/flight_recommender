Home-proud Nagoya, birthplace of Toyota and pachinko (a pinball-style game), is a manufacturing powerhouse. Although Nagoya's GDP tops that of many small countries, this middle child has grown accustomed to life in the shadow of its bigger brothers, Tokyo and Kansai.
In contrast to its industrial core, well-maintained parks and green spaces prevail in the inner wards. Nagoya has cosmopolitan aspects including some fantastic museums, significant temples and excellent shopping, and Nagoyans take pride in the unpretentious nature of their friendly, accessible city.
In spite of all this, the city still struggles to shake its reputation among Japanese (many who've never visited) as the nation's most boring metropolis. We're here to disagree.
In a prime spot between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka on the Tokaido shinkansen line, Nagoya is the gateway to Chubu's big mountain heart and a great base for day trips.
