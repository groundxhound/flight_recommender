Warsaw is a mixture of relaxing green spaces, historic sites and vivid modernity. Discover the charming Old Town, Wilanów Palace and amazing Lazienki Park, where you can watch free Chopin concerts every Sunday during the summer. Experience a few of the dozens of interactive museums, including the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Copernicus Science Centre. For exciting nightlife, visit the vibrant Vistula boulevards and upscale clubs. 
Once you’ve travelled around Poland, you realise this: Warsaw is different. Rather than being centred on an old market square, the capital is spread across a broad area with diverse architecture: restored Gothic, communist concrete, modern glass and steel.
