The economic and cultural powerhouse of the country thanks to an influx of oil money, Lagos has an exploding arts and music scene that will keep your yansh engaged far past dawn. If you're headed to Nigeria, you'll have no choice but to jump right in.
As well as brilliantly buoyant culture, Lagos has bumper-to-bumper cars, noise and pollution beyond belief, a high crime rate, and maxed-out public utilities. Elevated motorways ringing the island city are jammed with speed freaks and absurd traffic jams ('go-slows') on top, and tin-and-cardboard shacks underneath. It's a divided city, but an undeniably exciting one.
Named after the Portuguese word for lagoon, Lagos has been a Yoruba port, a British political centre and, until 1991, Nigeria's capital.
Unarguably the most economically active and socially diverse state in Nigeria, Lagos state is strategically positioned as the major convergence points for all other parts of the country and also the main entry point to the rest of the world. This has lead to the creation of a variety of destinations and spots meant for leisure, relaxation, exploration or just sheer amusement. Important to note, is the fact that most of these tourist attractions in lagos have a strong historical significance and storyline.
Just in case you find yourself in the city of Lagos at any time of the year, these destinations are definitely worth visiting.
