Santa Clara is Cuba's most revolutionary city – and not just because of its historical obsession with Argentine doctor turned guerrillero Che Guevara. Smack bang in the geographic center of Cuba, this is a city of new trends and insatiable creativity, where an edgy youth culture has been testing the boundaries of Cuba’s censorship police for years. Unique Santa Clara offerings include Cuba’s only official drag show, a graphic artists' collective that produces satirical political cartoons, and the best rock festival in the country: Ciudad Metal. The city’s fiery personality has been shaped over time by the presence of the nation’s most prestigious university outside Havana, and a long association with Che Guevara, whose liberation of Santa Clara in December 1958 marked the end of the Batista regime. Little cultural revolutions have been erupting here ever since. 
Santa Clara is an interesting town and the resting place of El Che Ernesto Guevara. The memorial and mausleum is worth visiting. 
We enjoyed our stay in a casa El Castillo Ivonnes cooking is brilliant and Jose is a wonderful host. Another one of our group stayed at Hostel Park View with Miguel and Noelys they are situated off the main square and the hostel is amazing.
We only stayed 2 days 1 night so we missed the cigar factory and the Flamenco dancing that was on the night we left. I would say a 2 or 3 day stay would be sufficent
