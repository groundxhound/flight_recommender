A two thousand year old city, situated at the junction of the Rhône and Saône rivers, Lyon rests below the impressive Fourvière and Croix Rousse hills. In Lyon, visitors can take a unique journey through time and across cultures, by strolling down its narrow streets, crossing its “traboules“ (narrow secret passages), walking along its bustling docks, passing through its impressive squares, and seeing over 200 sites illuminated at night.
Commanding a strategic spot at the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône Rivers, Lyon has been luring people ever since the Romans named it Lugdunum in 43 BC. Commercial, industrial and banking powerhouse for the past 500 years, Lyon is France's third largest city, and offers today's urban explorers a wealth of enticing experiences.
Outstanding museums, a dynamic cultural life, busy clubbing and drinking scenes, a thriving university and fantastic shopping lend the city a distinctly sophisticated air, while adventurous gourmets can indulge in their wildest gastronomic fantasies. Don't leave the city without sampling some Lyonnais specialities in a bouchon – the quintessential Lyon experience.
