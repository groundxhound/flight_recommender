Many visitors to Namibia start their adventure in Windhoek, the capital and largest city of this South African country. Nama, Herero, German, Afrikaans, and British cultures have influenced the growth and development of Windhoek. Visit the statue of Hosea Kutako, a nationalist hero, in the gardens surrounding the Tintenpalast, the seat of the Namibian legislature, or chow down on ostrich kebab or zebra steak at Joe’s Beerhouse before leaving on a safari into the Namibian wilderness. 
English is spoken throughout Namibia (it is the country's official language and is also the medium of instruction in most schools), although in many urban areas Afrikaans (similar to Dutch) is used as a lingua franca, as 50% of the Namibian population speaks Afrikaans. German is widely used in tourism and business. Oshiwambo is spoken by 50% of Namibians as a mother tongue.
Radio and television is also predominantly in English.
Other langauges include Oshiwambo, Otjiherero, Damara/Nama, Setswana, SiLozi, and Rukwangali.
