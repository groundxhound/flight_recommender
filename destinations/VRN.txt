So splendid was medieval Verona that its reputation alone inspired Shakespeare to set two plays here (Romeo and Juliet and The Two Gentlemen of Verona). Though its connection to the actual Capulets is tenuous at best, the so-called Juliet's House draws half a million tourists per year, many of them keen on reenacting the balcony scene. Don't miss the Roman amphitheater and the Palazzo Barberi. 
The city is famous as it is the place where William Shakespeare set his play Romeo and Juliet. Though situated an hour away from the more popular tourist destination, Venice, many people consider Verona a more relaxed, pleasant place to visit. In the year 2000 Verona has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its urban structure and architecture.
