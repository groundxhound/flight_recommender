As an urban center, Denver has come a long way. Sure you'll still catch a Stetson or two walking down the 16th St Mall, but the Intermountain West's cosmopolitan capital now delights in a growing culinary and arts scene, plus plenty of brewpubs, great parks and cycling trails, and close proximity to spectacular hiking, skiing and camping in the Rocky Mountains.
Thanks to a re-urbanization of the city's central core, Denver now has name-worthy neighborhoods with flavors that are all their own – River North (RiNo) for hipster bars and eye-catching street art, Lower Highlands (LoHi) and South Broadway for great eateries and live music, Cherry Creek for glam, Lower Downtown (LoDo) for upscale restaurants and cocktail lounges as well as the Golden Triangle and Santa Fe for arts, theater and museums. In all, there's a neighborhood and a vibe for just about anybody.
