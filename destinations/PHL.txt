Philadelphia, or 'Philly' as it's affectionately known, has all of the glamor of New York City and Washington, DC, while still retaining small-town charm. Because the city's oldest buildings are so well-preserved, America's early history and role in building democracy are sometimes more accessible here than in the capital. Moreover, it's a beautiful place that is easy and rewarding to explore, its streets dotted with gracious squares and linked by cobbled alleys.
From the start of the Revolutionary War until 1790 (when Washington, DC, was founded), Philadelphia was the new nation's capital. Eventually, NYC rose as a cultural, commercial and industrial center, and Philly slipped into a decline, intensified by the loss of industrial jobs. Some areas of the city are still blighted, but its core, from the manicured campuses of the University of Pennsylvania to the redbrick buildings of the Old City, is solid.
